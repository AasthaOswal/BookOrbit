## 🙋‍♀️ Why I Built This

Hi, I'm Aastha 👋  
I have recently started reading books...

One day, I was searching online for *"The Psychology of Money"* by Morgan Housel. On Amazon, it was listed for ₹220 — plus ₹30 delivery charges, bringing the total to ₹250.

Later that week, I walked into a nearby local bookstore and found the **exact same book** for just **₹150** — no delivery fee, no extra cost.  
That moment made me realize:  
> **Local bookstores offer cheaper prices than online giants like Amazon — they just don’t have online visibility.**

That experience sparked an idea:  
💡 *What if I could build a website to help this local bookstore reach more readers — without needing to depend on platforms like Amazon?*
